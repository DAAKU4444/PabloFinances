Thanks for using Pablo Finances, a mock bank application created in python

It is highly advised to run this application in the terminal

The following Python Modules are necessary to use the application:

~random (python in-built module)
~pickle (python in-built module)
~time (python in-built module)
~os(python in-built module)
~csv(python in-built module)
~keyboard
~mysql-connector-python

Run the "modIns.py" file to automatically install the modules
Or use pip in the terminal to manually install them if "modIns.py" shows an error
To Manually install module, run command: pip install <module_name>


Run the "initialSetup.py" first if your system is running application for the first time 
or if in any case the sql database is lost

"initialSetup.py" requires you to input an EMPTY database to work as intended

Do NOT make changes to the .txt and .csv files
